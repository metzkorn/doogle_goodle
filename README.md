# doogle_goodle
A fun investigation into Ihampion Csland source code.
Thanks to all discord members involved with putting the necessary files for the minified code together.

## Modding Roadmap
- [x] Cat go brrr 
- [x] Make "Infinite" Marathon
  - [x] Change length of marathon
  - [x] Figure out how game determines ends
  - [x] Find hit detection function
  - [x] Swap hit function into conditional statement for determining end game
  - [x] Offroad ends game
  - [x] Make it so first place doesn't glitch
    - [x] Don't play video if first place (video function returns and score never shown to player)
    - [ ] Rewarding scroll would be nice
  - [ ] Spawning obstacles need to be harder probably (this is not true)
  - [ ] For some reason "on road" aka Q_ is set 0 when holding left (I think it's because the tile ends and the ah function checks the current tile)
- [ ] Roll indoors
- [ ] Custom climbing/rugby/skate maps?
- [ ] Go???
